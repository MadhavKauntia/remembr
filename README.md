# remembr

The idea behind **remembr** was to create an application where you could take notes and which would help you remember what you learn through spaced retention and quizzes. This could be done by sending the user snippets from the notes through email across a span of days.

Current implementation allows user to login to the application using Google Auth and take notes. It works as a basic note-taking application.
